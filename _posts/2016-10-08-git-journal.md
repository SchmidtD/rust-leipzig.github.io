Documenting changes is one of the hardest things during development. Finding variable names, describing how to use
an API or even writing sensible commit messages can sometimes feels like a waste of time. But every good developer will
agree that the first rule should be to write code that your successor will love it. The same rule applies to the
documentation: It is just satisfying if the new team member reads and understands your code just by the documentation
instead of annoying you and others all the time. This also has an economical impact, for sure.

One very important part of the documentation is the (git) commit message history since it refers to a usual workflows
like `git blame` or `git bisect`. Viewing the `git log` for getting up to date if you were on vacation is just another
scenario. If your team does not follow a commit message rule set then it will be hard to get necessary information from
the commit message.

Usually, maintaining a separate changelog file should not be needed at all. The necessary information are already
available within the git log. But as already mentioned, they are often just crap. This means we maintain an extra file
for the history of the product, which will be messed up by merge conflicts, wrong or completely missing entries.

# How to trash your CHANGELOG file
Alright, [git-journal](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal) tries to solve all these problems mentioned above.
It will prepare your commit and verify it after your edit. If your commits follow the defined rules it will be possible
to generate a CHANGELOG file from your commits. It is also possible to define a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
based template for your CHANGELOG, which will enable you to categorize even single entries within the commit message.
